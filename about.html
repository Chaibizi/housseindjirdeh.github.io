 About<strong> Me</strong>

<section class="aboutme">
<p>I wrote my first line of code five years ago during my first semester studying mechanical engineering. It was C, and the very first assignment had me feeling like:</p>

<p>A few years later, I landed my first internship at a <a href="http://www.onramp-solutions.com/">small software start-up</a> developing an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) for manufacturing companies.</p>

<p>In my last year of university, I had an idea. With two other university students, I pitched to a startup incubator at University of Toronto, <a href="https://hatchery.engineering.utoronto.ca/">the Hatchery</a>, and got accepted. Neither of us had any web development experience, but we were hungry to learn. With no idea what we were getting ourselves into, I started by building my <a href="http://tandemedu.ca/">first ever website.</a> It was a simple landing page, but ever since then, I've been obsessed with all things web.</p>

<p>So where am I right now? I currently work at <a href="http://www.deloittedigital.ca/">Deloitte Digital</a>, a full-service digital firm, where I help tackle all sorts of digital challenges big and small. In my current project, I'm developing a single-page application for <a href="http://sonnet.ca/">Sonnet Insurance</a>, a major P&amp;C insurance company, using Rails to build a JSON REST API that interacts with an AngularJS front-end.</p>
