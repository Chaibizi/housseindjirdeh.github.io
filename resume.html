          <p>
            I wrote my first line of code five years ago during my first semester studying mechanical engineering. It was C, and the very first assignment had me feeling like <a href="{{ site.url }}/public/overwhelmed.gif" target="_blank">this.</a>
          </p>

          <p>
            In my last year of university, I joined the Hatchery, a startup incubator at University of Toronto. I began by building my <a href="http://tandemedu.ca/" target="_blank">first ever website</a> and ever since then, I've been obsessed with the web.
          </p>

          <p>
            I work at <a href="http://www.deloittedigital.ca/" target="_blank">Deloitte Digital</a>, a full-service digital consulting firm. I was on the team that built the web platform for <a href="https://www.sonnet.ca/" target="_blank">Sonnet Insurance.</a> We used Rails to build a JSON REST API that interacts with an AngularJS front end.
          </p>

          <p>
            I enjoying building side projects in my free time. My most recent was a <a href="https://github.com/hdjirdeh/angular2-hn" target="_blank">Hacker News client</a> built with Angular CLI, RxJS and Webpack. This picked up some traction in the Angular 2 community which was pretty dope.
          </p>

          <p>
            I try to post regularly on my <a href="/blog" target="_blank">blog</a> which gets a decent amount of hits (10,000+ pageviews a month).
