I wrote my first line of code in 2010 while studying my first year of mechanical engineering (it was C). The very first lab tutorial had me so overwhelmed I felt like:

I wish I could write about how I made my first website back when I was a young kid, but nope, I actually only made my first website in the summer of last year, right after I graduated from my undergraduate study in mechanical engineering.

my first website in 1998 on Notepad and Netscape Navigator, and spent my adolescence making websites for fun. Later, I became a professional chef and worked in kitchens for nearly a decade.

In early 2015, I decided on a career change, and now I work as a web developer.

I created this blog for other autodidacts like myself. With determination and positivity, there’s nothing you can’t achieve.

I can usually be found listening to Toto by Africa or playing Battletoads.

Feel free to connect with me over Twitter, GitHub, Codepen, etc.

P.S. I recommend New Moon for syntax highlighting.
